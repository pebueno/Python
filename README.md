# Understanding Python
> Code sources and commented description

Through this repository I'll store my studies content relative to Python. So it's possible to find the different topics organized in folders with code examples.
Feel free if you want to help complete the subject adding anything here or have a suggestion to improve the method of presenting information. 

## Usage

All examples are in teaching order, so starting from the basics of console log to advanced concepts. Make sure that you have Python 3 installed and just run `python3 <dir>/<file>` to run the examples.

> Some examples have commented explanation and code within them, so you might want try uncommenting them and checking out different parts of the code.
